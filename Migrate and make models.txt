Django sequence for making and adding tables for the database. 

1.) migrate all the pending migrations
2.) Create model class in the models.py for the table
(look up the documentation for further syntax) 
3.) Add the app as proper appname.apps.(appname)Config
4.) python manage.py makemigrations (for the newly created table) 
5.) What are migrations? 
--> migrations are pending changes that are stored in the apps migration folder
    to change the database the migrations have to be applied. 
6.) again run python manage.py migrate to apply the create table in the database
7.) register the model created in the admin.py of the parent project (not the app)
